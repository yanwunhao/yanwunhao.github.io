This is Wenhao "Rubie" Yan (Chinese: È¢úÊñáË±™, Japanese: „Ç¨„É≥„ÄÄ„Éñ„É≥„Ç¥„Ç¶), I am now a Ph.D Candidate in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences of Sophia University under supervision of [Prof. Gonsalves](https://redb.cc.sophia.ac.jp/index.php?action=pages_view_main&active_action=cvclient_view_main_init&cvid=tadgonsalves&display_type=cv&block_id=437), starting in Spring 2024. I was born in Yangzhou, China. I received B.Eng from Yangzhou University, China, advised by [Prof. Guo](https://xxgcxy.yzu.edu.cn/info/1020/5987.htm) in 2018, and received M.Sc. from Muroran Institute of Technology, Japan, under the supervision of [Prof. Li](https://u.muroran-it.ac.jp/enes/~heli/index.html) in 2023. I was an employee of ZTE Corporation from 2018 to 2020, working on developing Big Data analysis workflow based on Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Spark.

My recent research interest includes Internet-of-Things (IoT), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Federated Learning (FL). Using the above techniques, I aim to build privacy responsible machine learning models for information sensitive areas like medicine or healthcare. The scattered distribution of user data in different clients brings training various challenges, therefore I am working to address these issues. I also pay attention to efficiency optimization of Federated Learning and Distributed Systems. I hope my works could help improving the real-world AI applications in the coming future.

I am open to various kinds of collaboration, if you are interested in my research, please drop an email to **wh-yan@eagle.sophia.ac.jp** or **wh.yan(at)hotmail.com**.
